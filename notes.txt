Use lodash to better handle objects and arrays

Handle objects using:
    -   a core template library (just a list of objects)
    -   a spawned_objects list. Contains a list of all spawned objects in the game. Each has a unique id and a location (e.g. charachter inventory)
    -

Find object:
    -   foreach does itemname match inputstring
    -   check specific value matches specific peram
