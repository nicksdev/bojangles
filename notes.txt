    Run a combat action for each mob in turn:
        Attack - who? Attack type weapon, magic, special (cooldowns & charges)
        Calc defence rolls
        If hit calc effects (damage, special or magic effects)
        Did target die? If so create corpse and remove mob
        If Character dead, then end game
    Unset combat flag



Random object lists

Items that apply constant effects

Magic System

Use lodash to better handle objects and arrays

Handle objects using:
    -   a core template library (just a list of objects)
    -   a spawned_objects list. Contains a list of all spawned objects in the game. Each has a unique id and a location (e.g. charachter inventory)
    -



//



Find object:
    -   foreach does itemname match inputstring
    -   check specific value matches specific peram

CONTAINER SPAWNING

- Containers that spawn fixed content
- Containers that spawn dynamic content (loot lists)
- Items that spawn fixed qunatity
- Items that spawn dynamic quantity
- Loot lists that vary by level



spawnItem(itemname,qtyLow,qtyHi,percLow,percHi)

loot[level][perc];

container: [

    spawnFixed : true,
    fixedContent: [
        [itemnameOne,1,1,1,49],
        [itemnameTwo,1,1,50,100]
    spawnVari : true,
    variContent:
        quantity:   5,
        lootlist:   Z,
        lootlevel:  1
